## About

Important: This addon requires that the MariaDB add-on is installed and running!

This add-on is experimental, and provides a webmail frontend that connects
to the Mailserver add-on. It also enables you to configure Sieve scripts
for your mailbox.

You reach the Roundcube interface by clicking the Web UI button in the add-on
page to use ingress feature. Login with your IMAP credentials.
If you want to reach the add-on directly you can specify a port in the optional
ports section. Lets say you set the port 2665:
Point your browser to: http://{homeassistant IP}:2665.
If you enable the SSL option it is https://{homeassistant IP}:2665.
It is also possible to use the hostname insted of IP address.
If you want to forward your chosen port in your router, HTTPS is
highly recommended!
