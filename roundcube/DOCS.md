Roundcube web based email client.

![Supports aarch64 Architecture][aarch64-shield] ![Supports amd64 Architecture][amd64-shield]

## About

Important: This addon requires that the MariaDB app is installed and running!

This app is experimental, and provides a webmail frontend that connects
to the Mailserver app. It also enables you to configure Sieve scripts
for your mailbox.

You reach the Roundcube interface by clicking the Web UI button in the app
page to use ingress feature. Login with your IMAP credentials.
If you want to reach the app directly you can specify a port in the optional
ports section. Lets say you set the port 2665:
Point your browser to: http://{homeassistant IP}:2665.
If you enable the SSL option it is https://{homeassistant IP}:2665.
It is also possible to use the hostname insted of IP address.
If you want to forward your chosen port in your router, HTTPS is
highly recommended!
